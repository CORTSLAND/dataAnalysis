Hand-Written image processing practice

The main idea of this was to scan in hand written images and using k-means clustering to recognize each hand written image.

Part 1:
Load in data set and predict using k-means.

Part 2:
Zip images with its label and project it to a 4X4 Matrix

Part 3:
Created a confusion matrix to see the predicted vs. actual.

Part 4:
Used the elbow method to find the best k.

Part 5: 
Implemented t-SNE to take the 64-Dimensional data to 2-dimensional for a better understanding of the data.
